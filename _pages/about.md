I'm Kate, I use computer science and engineering to solve challenges in biology.

I work closely with multiple labs parts of the [Braingeneers](https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/) project.

During my PhD in [Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics (BMEB)](https://pbse.ucsc.edu/bmeb/index.html) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I focused on developing [Platforms for In Vitro Electrophysiology Experiments on the Internet of Things](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/19j6k625), advised by [David Haussler](https://hausslergenomics.ucsc.edu/) and [Mircea Teodorescu](https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=mteodore).

Currently, I am continuing this work as a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/).

I also co-founded [Open Culture Science, Inc.](https://www.openculturesci.com/), a company dedicated to advancing cloud biology and automated cell culture worldwide.
